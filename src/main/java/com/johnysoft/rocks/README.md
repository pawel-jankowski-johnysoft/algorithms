You are an avid rock collector who lives in southern California. 
Some rare and desirable rocks just became available in New York, so you are planning a cross-country road trip. 
There are several other rare rocks that you could pick up along the way. 
You have been given a grid filled with numbers, representing the number of rare rocks available in various cities across the country.
Your objective is to find the optimal path from So_Cal to New_York that would allow you to accumulate the most rocks along the way.

Note: You can only travel either north (up) or east (right).
b) Consider adding some additional tests in doTestsPass().
c) Implement optimalPath() correctly.
d) Here is an example:
^
{{0, 0, 0, 0, 5}, New_York (finish) N
{0, 1, 1, 1, 0},
So_Cal (start) {2, 0, 0, 0, 0}} S
v
The total for this example would be 10 (2+0+1+1+1+0+5)."
